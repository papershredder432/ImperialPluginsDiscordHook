# A doohickey for ImperialPlugins merchants(?)

## Yes it's bad. I haven't made a Discord.Net bot in a while.

## Features
 ***Basically all of this is untested as I do not have an API key yet***
- [x] Login to ImperialPlugins with an API key
- [x] Get a list of all your products, customers, and their servers
- [x] Show all active promotions (coupons)
    - [x] A blacklist of promotions to not show (coupons for individual customers)
- [ ] Whitelist and blacklist servers
- [ ] Sends you a message when a customer requests a whitelist
  - [ ] Shows a modal with the server information in question
  - [ ] Allows you to respond via the modal (accept, deny, reply, etc.)
- [ ] Lets customers register in your Discord server for special roles (Customer role and per product roles)
